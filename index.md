**If you found the camera, please follow the [instructions](/instructions.md) (French or English). If needed, [contact us](/contact.md).**

# Concept

**Shoot'N'Pass** is an experiment of collaborative photography where everyday people collaborate in the photographic capture of a city's spirit: its people, its darkest and brightest corners, its hidden gems, its pockets of beauty.

Several disposable cameras are spread throughout the city. They all contain the same [instructions](/instructions.md): **shoot** a picture of your city; **pass** the camera to someone else you don't know.

Results will be displayed on this page.

# Contribute!
