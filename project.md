# Concept

**Shoot'N'Pass** is an experiment of collaborative photography where everyday people collaborate in the photographic capture of a city's spirit: its people, its darkest and brightest corners, its hidden gems, its pockets of beauty.

Several disposable cameras are spread throughout the city. The idea is simple: **shoot** a picture of your city;
**pass** the camera to a stranger, see detailed [instructions](/instructions.md).

Results will be displayed on this page.

# Results

The first cameras have just been sent. In the meantime, find the result of a pilot experiment from 2018.
In Cuba, we gave a disposable camera to a family from la Havana for a week.
